# OpentreeExtractor_Shiny

I planned to design a web app that :

1. user provide a species list
2. the app will return a table about name match agaist Open Tree database
3. and a subset tree of Open Tree based on the user provide list

In this way, users can avoid to use any script to generate the desired tree
